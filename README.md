# ChronoQuest

## Story

You are a daring **time-traveling adventurer**, seeking the legendary **Chrono Diamond**, a jewel said to shine brighter than the stars themselves.

Your journey begins at your **starting airport**, where the display board greets you:

> ‚ÄúWelcome to KJFK! You have **$1000** and **5000 km of range** left.‚Äù

With money and fuel in hand, you take your first flight. Some airports hide **lootboxes**‚Äîoffering extra money, score, or range. Others conceal **bandits**, ready to rob you of your treasures.

Your quest takes you across **USA, Finland, Sweden, Japan, Germany, and Norway**. Each airport may hold a **goal**‚Äîcomplete it for rewards and points.
Some goals are easy, others are rare. If luck is on your side, you may stumble upon the **Chrono Diamond** itself.

But beware: to truly win, you must **return to your starting airport**, diamond in hand, with your money and victories intact.

Can you outsmart fate, survive the journey, and etch your name into history?
